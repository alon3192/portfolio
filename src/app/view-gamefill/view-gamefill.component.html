    <h2>Gamefill</h2>

    <p class="description">Below you will find pictures from an Android app I created that aims to save results from console games that show up in different stasistics.
         There is a tournament winnings table, a temporary tournament table and an all time table. In addition, 
         you can see all the results of the games played. 
         You can delve further and see head-to-head results between 2 players
          (how many wins, draws, losses, credit and mandatory goals have on each side), plus see specific player results.
           The data is saved in Firebase.</p>
